# This is my journal for Info Science
CLASS 1
1. What did we do?

We watched a video introducing us to the basics of Info Science, we also learned about the different ways to solve problems using computational thinking.  After this introduction we were presented with a sandwich making activity.  In this activity we had to create a extremely detailed "recipe" and present it to Dr. Ruebn, who made the sandwich for us. 

2. What is I learn?

I learned about the 4 components of computational thinking, decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithms.  I also learned that when coding, all of the actions need to be extremely detailed, in order for the final product to be successful.  

3. What questions do I have?

How do I understand coding better?

Are there different languges of coding?

CLASS 2
We went through our homework, which was to research and make a circle in Processing.  We also followed the teacher and create a few things using coding in Processing.  At the end we tired to make a dice on our own, which required a bit of research.

I learning how to code, and many ways things can be manipulated to change the final produce/outcome.

How do I make a dice?
