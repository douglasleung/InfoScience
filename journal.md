# This is my journal for Info Science

1. What did we do?

We watched a video introducing us to the basics of Info Science, we also learned about the different ways to solve problems using computational thinking.  After this introduction we were presented with a sandwich making activity.  In this activity we had to create a extremely detailed "recipe" and present it to Dr. Ruebn, who made the sandwich for us. 

2. What is I learn?

I learned about the 4 components of computational thinking, decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithms.  I also learned that when coding, all of the actions need to be extremely detailed, in order for the final product to be successful.  

3. What questions do I have?

How do I understand coding better?
